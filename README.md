-----------------------------------------
Finally the windows phone app.

There is no official release yet.

-----------------------------------------

Known file limitations:

- You can launch any associated app in Remote Files view through phone's Internet Explorer. Local files cannot be opened
  in Explorer (Security Setting). 

- Local files can be viewed by stripped down Internet Explorer-View if their are HTML or text-based files.
- Image files should be accessible via Internet Explorer too.
- Audio & media files could be opened via API call to build-in MediaPlayer (if the media type will be recognized).
- Currently there is no possibility to open Office-based files or PDF-documents from local storage (remote files will work).
- No chance to edit any file. A tiny text editor is planned but all other file types are a hard piece of work.
- However for WP8 there will be so called "file and uri associations" which will enable some kind of communication between apps and make file extensions callable.
